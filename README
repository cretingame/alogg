				 version 1.3.4



alogg is a library which makes it easier to use Ogg/Vorbis streams with
Allegro. It offers facilities to decode, stream, and encode Ogg/Vorbis
streams with thread support and experimental URL streaming, and integrates
those facilities with Allegro's datafile and sample loading routines.

 -- Dependencies

alogg requires the following:

  libogg-1.0rc3       (or newer, available at http://www.vorbis.com/)
  libvorbis-1.0rc3    (or newer, available at http://www.vorbis.com/)
  allegro-4.0.0       (or newer, available at http://alleg.sf.net/)

To compile with Tremor, a fixed point implementation of the Ogg/Vorbis
decoder, you also a copy of the Tremor library. Tremor can be found at
http://www.xiph.org/.

To compile with URL support, you also need libcurl 7.10 or newer. libcurl
is a library for transferring data specified with URL syntax, available at
http://curl.haxx.se/.
Note that URL streaming is experimental is not ready for production use yet.
In particular, I have not yet tried to stream off an Icecast server.

To compile with threaded streaming support, you also need pthreads. pthreads
is the most widely used library for thread support, and is supplied with
most operating systems. You can even get a version of pthreads for MS-DOS
and MS-Windows. For the latter, it can be found somewhere at
http://www.redhat.com.

Integration with Allegro's load_sample requires Allegro 4.1.1.
If you have an older version of Allegro and want to be able to use
load_sample to load Ogg/Vorbis streams, you can patch Allegro this way:

  cd /home/user/allegro # or wherever you put Allegro
  patch -p1 < /home/user/alogg-1.3.4/sample.diff # or wherever you put alogg

You also have to link against the Ogg/Vorbis libraries in order for the
grabber to link. If you use Unix, DJGPP or Mingw32, the supplied linker
scripts will do this for you automatically. If you use another platform,
or want to use Tremor, you will have to apply a patch to Allegro's makefile.
If you want to use libvorbis, use libs.diff; if you want to use Tremor, use
tremor.diff. The datogg grabber plugin needs to be told that Tremor is
to be used instead of libvorbis, and Allegro has no support for plugin
specific compile time scripts, so this must be done by hand.
You can apply the patch to the Allegro distribution like this:

  cd /home/user/allegro # or wherever you put Allegro
  patch -p0 < /home/user/alogg-1.3.4/libs.diff # or wherever you put alogg

or, if using Tremor:

  cd /home/user/allegro # or wherever you put Allegro
  patch -p0 < /home/user/alogg-1.3.4/tremor.diff # or wherever you put alogg

If you do not have patch, then your mileage may vary. You might have to
modify a project file, depending on how your compiler does this.


For information on how to build alogg and use it in your programs, have a
look in the alogg documentation.



 -- Documentation

alogg's documentation can be generated in multiple formats. To generate
the documentation in:
 - HTML, type "make docs TYPE=html"
 - texinfo, type "make docs TYPE=texi"
etc.
Make sure that Allegro's makedoc program is in your path, as it will be
used to generate the documentation. For a complete list of the formats
the doc can be generated in, see makedoc.
